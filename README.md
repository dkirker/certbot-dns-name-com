Certbot DNS Auth Plugin for name.com
===============================================================================================================

There are a number of blog posts on the internet (including [certbot's own](https://certbot.eff.org/faq#does-let-s-encrypt-issue-wildcard-certificates))
indicating that you can use DNS to obtain certificates, but few actual instructions for doing so.
This repo attempts to provide both better end-to-end instructions for obtaining certificates based
on DNS authentication (below) and also a script (written by [@laonan](https://github.com/laonan))
for doing so.


## Installation

### Package-Based

The easiest way is to install the package (currently only available on deb-based systems - please
contribute if you know how to package for other systems!), which is available at
https://packages.kaelshipman.me/. It is called `certbot-dns-namecom`. Installing it will create a
configuration file at `/etc/certbot-dns-namecom.config.json` with values that you've indicated in
your package setup.

### Manual

If you prefer to install manually, here's what you need to do (roughly):

1. Put the `src/certbot-dns-name_com.py` script somewhere on your machine (cloning this repo to your
   home directory is sufficient, so long as you don't move it after, since certbot will use the same
   location for renewals).
2. Have `python3` installed.
3. Create a json config file somewhere. **NOTE: This file should be readable only by root, since it
   will contain sensitive credentials for your DNS service.** The default location is
   `/etc/certbot-dns-namecom.config.json`, but you can technically put it anywhere.
4. (Optional) If you do use a location other than the default one for your config file, you'll have
   to create a wrapper script that sets the `CERTBOT_DNS_NAMECOM_CONFIG` environment variable like
   so:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash
   
   export CERTBOT_DNS_NAMECOM_CONFIG=/path/to/your/config.json  
   /usr/bin/certbot-dns-namecom.py $@
   ```

   In this case, if this file were saved at, e.g., `/home/you/certbot-dns.sh`, you would have to
   ensure that file is executable and then use that path instead of the default path in the code
   snippet below.

## Usage

Once installed (and configured), all you have to do to issue a certificate is the following:

```sh
# First do a dry run to make sure it's going to work properly
certbot certonly --manual --manual-auth-hook /usr/bin/certbot-dns-namecom.py -d your-domain.com --agree-tos --email you@your-domain.com --dry-run

# Once that succeeds, you can do the real thing
certbot certonly --manual --manual-auth-hook /usr/bin/certbot-dns-namecom.py -d your-domain.com --agree-tos --email you@your-domain.com
```

Doing this will create certificate and key files in a subdirectory in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/`. See
output of the above commands for the specific directories. These are the files you will point to
from your webserver to facilitate an encrypted connection over HTTPS. Follow existing guides on the
internet for enabling SSL/TLS using these files for your given webserver.


## Contributing

Note that there is no special setup at this time for development on this repo. You should be able to
simply clone it and make modifications. Simple, but at a cost: there is also no testing. You should
expect to test by just running the script against your DNS server to see if it works.

### Packaging

This repo uses [`peekaygee`](https://github.com/kael-shipman/peekaygee) for packaging. At the time
of this writing, there is only a Debian package for this plugin. However, if others know how to
create packages for other systems, you are welcome to contribute additional package source materials
here (and contribute implementations in `peekaygee` for making building and publishing easier).
